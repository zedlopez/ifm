{*}"Midsummer Day"

East of the Garden is the Gazebo. Above is the Treehouse. A billiards table is in the Gazebo. On it is a trophy cup. A starting pistol is in the cup. In the Treehouse is a container called a cardboard box.

Test me with "up / x box / d / e / x table / x cup / x pistol / get cup".
