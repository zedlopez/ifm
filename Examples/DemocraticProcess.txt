"Stop" and "Continue" are most useful when we need to write rules that will have to stop the action some of the time but at other times let it pass; so for instance:

	{*}"Democratic Process"
	
	Before inserting something which is not carried by the player into something:
		if the noun is in the second noun, say "Already done." instead;
		say "(first taking [the noun])[line break]";
		silently try taking the noun;
		if the player is not holding the noun, stop the action.
	
	Before putting something which is not carried by the player on something:
		if the noun is on the second noun, say "Already done." instead;
		say "(first taking [the noun])[line break]";

		if the player is not holding the noun, stop the action.
	
	The Assembly Room is a room. "On most days, this room is used for elementary school assemblies; at the moment, it serves as a voting place." The ballot is on the desk. The desk is in the Assembly Room.
	
	The machine is a container in the Assembly Room. "On the ballot machine is a sign which reads 'PUT BALLOTS IN ME :)'." Understand "ballot machine" as the machine.
	
	Test me with "put ballot in machine".
